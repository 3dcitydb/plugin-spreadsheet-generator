3. About
--------

By using the SPSHI (Spreadsheet Importer) plugin, it is possible to import
data from an online spreadsheet hosted in a cloud service or a local XLSX file into a 3D City Database (3DCityDB) instance. 


4. Requirements
---------------

This version of the Spreadsheet Importer Plugin shall be used with
version 1.4 or later versions of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter. 
It cannot be guaranteed that the extension does correctly work with any
previous version of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.


5. (Un)Installation
-------------------

The plugin is shipped as a precompiled and ready-to-use JAR package
called "spreadsheet_import.jar". Following simple steps will guide you through the
install process:  

*	Open the folder that contains your locally installed instance of the
Importer/Exporter (the installation directory).
*	Open the plugins subfolder. If it is not available, create a new subfolder
and name it "plugins". 
* Extract the downloaded zip file in the plugins folder. As a result a new
folder named "spreadsheet importer" will be created. The spreadsheet folder will
contain all required files and subfolders.
* Run the Importer/Exporter.


If you want to uninstall the Spreadsheet Importer Plugin, simply delete
the "spreadsheet importer" subfolder and all its contents.

3. About
--------

By using the SPSHG (Spreadsheet Generator) plugin, it is possible to export
data from a 3D City Database (3DCityDB) instance into a CSV file or into an
online spreadsheet hosted in a cloud service. The CSV file may be imported
to either a spreadsheet application (like Microsoft Excel or Open Office Calc)
or to a web based online spreadsheet service (like Google Docs). All features
of spreadsheet programs, like calculation and graphing tools, are applicable
to the exported data from a 3D City Database instance. 


4. Requirements
---------------

This version of the Spreadsheet Generator Plugin shall only be used with
version 2.0 of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter. 
It cannot be guaranteed that the extension does correctly work with any
previous or later version of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.


5. (Un)Installation
-------------------

The plugin is shipped as a precompiled and ready-to-use JAR package
called "spreadsheet_generator.jar". Following simple steps will guide you through the
install process:  

*	Open the folder that contains your locally installed instance of the
Importer/Exporter version 2.0.0 (the installation directory).
*	Open the plugins subfolder. If it is not available, create a new subfolder
and name it "plugins". 
* Extract the downloaded zip file in the plugins folder. As a result a new
folder named "spreadsheet_generator" will be created. The spreadsheet_generator folder will
contain all required files and subfolders.
* Run the Importer/Exporter.


If you want to uninstall the Spreadsheet Generator Plugin, simply delete
the "spreadsheet" subfolder and all its contents.
